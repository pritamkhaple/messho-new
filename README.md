In this app we will be making a Word and Character counter app.
First there needs to be a <code>textarea</code> element which will take the input
from user.

Below that element, create 2 divs with id="word-counter" and id="char-counter" respectively.
#word-counter will show the number of words(empty space is not considered a word) and #char-counter will show the number of characters typed.

Also make an input with id="char-limit-input" which takes a number which is the limit of characters we can type in.
By default char limit should be 50.

And the last input should be a slider input(with id ="fontSize-input") for taking the font size, default and min value should be 16px and max would be 32px.
